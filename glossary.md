# Cloud Native Glossary

## Cloud native business impact 

Business operating models in todayâ€™s world have shifted dramatically. Faced with a rapid pace of change, organizations must continuously adjust to new technology developments and customer demands. Digital transformation has now led to a world where organizations largely derive value and revenue through digital interactions. No longer is technology merely supporting business processes, it has become a strategic differentiator. 

Cloud native technologies allow organizations to deliver digital products and services to market faster while increasing scalability, stability, and resiliency.  This enables them to elastically scale based on customer needs ensuring business continuity. Additionally, cloud native technologies automate a lot of the operational work improving efficiency.  In short, cloud native technologies enable organizations to  adapt as market needs shift while minimizing operations cost.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining a community and ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects which focus on driving business value. We are a neutral space for open collaboration and innovation that enables the creation of new billion-dollar markets.
