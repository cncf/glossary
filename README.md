# Cloud Native Glossary

The [CNCF](cncf.io) Cloud Native Glossary Project is intended to be used as a reference for common terms used when talking about cloud native applications. 

## Working with definitions

To make it easier to work on individual terms, we've moved them into individual files in the [definitions folder](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/tree/main/definitions). Each term falls under one of three categories: 1) technology, 2) property, and 3) concept.
