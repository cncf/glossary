## Loosely Coupled Architecture

A loosely coupled architecture is a system design approach in which an application has little knowledge or reliance on a separate application. Microservices are an example of this architectural approach with a focus on narrowing an application's external dependencies. 

Loosely coupled architecture is the opposite of tightly coupled architecture.

When applications and processes are reliant on each other, the development lifecycle also needs to be intertwined. Updates, scaling, testing, and new features will be implemented against more extensive codebase. The larger the codebase and its dependencies, the more the application can be considered a monolith.

By decoupling an application, application development will be quicker since external dependencies will not hamper it. At an organizational level, teams can be structured around their competency, focusing on the specific application.
