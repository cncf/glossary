## Loosely Coupled Architecture

### What it is

Loosely Coupled Architecture is a system design approach in which applications are lean, with a single responsibility, without many dependencies, allowing teams to work, deploy, fail and scale independently, increasing business responsiveness. Microservices are an example of this architectural approach with a focus on narrowing an application's external dependencies.

### Problem it addresses

When applications and processes are reliant on each other, the development lifecycle also needs to be intertwined. Updating, scaling, testing, and adding new features against an extensive codebase increases technical debt and decreases feasibility. 

### How it helps

By decoupling an application, application development will be quicker since external dependencies will not hamper it. At an organizational level, teams can be structured around their competency, focusing on the specific application.
