## Nodes

A node is a computer that works in concert with other computers, or nodes, to accomplish a common task. When we talk about cloud native platforms a node could be a physical computer, a virtual computer, referred to as a VM, or even a container.

A node exists to run apps or processes as part of a group of computers. A node is part of a cluster, or group, of nodes that works together in concert.

A node gives you a distinct unit of computer, memory/cpu/network, that you can assign to a cluster. In a cloud native platform or app a node represents a single unit that can perform work. Ideally, individual nodes are undifferentiated in that any one node of a particular type is indistinguishable from any other node of the same type.
