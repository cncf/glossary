## Tightly Coupled Architectures

Tightly Couple Architectures are a concept of system design and computing where every hardware and software components that are linked together in such manner that each component is dependent upon each other. It promotes interdependent applications and code which are fragile as minor issue in one segment can bring the whole system down. Tightly Coupled Architectures integrates enterprise applications around a single point of truth, which is often a single spatially-enabled RDBMS.

A major disadvantage of Loosely Coupled Architecture is that it has a very low data rate and is very inconsistent. 

Whereas, Tightly Coupled Architectures' major advantage  is that it enables the rapid and efficient processing of large volumes of data, provides a single point of truth instead of several, often redundant, data sources, and enables open access to data throughout the organization. And hence this type of architecture is also used in parallel procesing systems.
