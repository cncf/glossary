## Portability

### What it is

Portability is a characteristic attributed to a computer program if it can be used in an operating system, other than the one in which it was created without requiring major rework. A computer software application is considered portable to a new environment if the effort required to adapt it to the new environment is within reasonable limits. The phrase "to port" means to modify software and make it adaptable to work on a different computer system.

### Problem it Addresses

Portability is a form of reusability. Some kinds of software are known to be less portable than others. When a software is not portable then its behavior will differ across environments. This distinction in execution often leads to poorly functioning software: it seemingly works in one place, but is buggy when you run it somewhere else.

### How it helps

This problem is solved by portability by building executable programs for different platforms from source code; this is what is usually understood by "porting".
