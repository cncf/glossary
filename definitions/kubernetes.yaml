  Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source technology, originally created by Google, that manages, or orchestrates, containers across clusters. Just like there is an OS that manages your laptop, Kubernetes manages cluster resources for the containerized apps. and  automates software deployment, scaling, and management. 

  Before Kubernetes, software deployment and management was very manual, labor intensive and required hands-on work from developers and engineers 24x7.  Often testing , QA, deployment, maintenance and hosting resource configuration and allocation was done by different people at different times using different tools over many man hours. This can lead to higher cost and is more prone to errors which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

  Kubernetes enables you to pre-wire your environment to have automation for software deployment testing, batch execution, application scaling, load balancing, storage, hosting resources and monitoring. The automation saves money by both reducing the amount of time spent and resources used for deployment and hosting while making your application more secure and improving its performance and the end user experience.
