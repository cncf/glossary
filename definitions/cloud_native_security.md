## Cloud Native Security

**Status:** Completed

Cloud native security is an approach for securing cloud native applications. This approach ensures that security requirements are included throughout a cloud native applications lifecycle (develop, distribute, deploy, and runtime). Cloud native security seeks to ensure the same conditions of diligence, integrity, trust, and threat prevention as traditional security models while integrating modern concepts of ephemerality, distribution, and immutability.

The traditional perimeter-based security approaches are designed for static environments and are hard to scale across highly dynamic, interconnected, and distributed architectures

Cloud native security introduces a new paradigm that protects applications by migrating from a perimeter-based approach to one where security moves closer to dynamic workloads. This approach identifies and secures workloads to meet the scale needs of cloud native applications while accommodating constant flux. It also requires the adoption of increased automation in the application security lifecycle to ensure availability, assurance, resilience, and redundancy at scale.
