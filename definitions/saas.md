## Software as a Service (SaaS)

### What it is

Software as a [service](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/service.md) (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based services over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Gmail, Amazon Web Services, GitHub, Slack). SaaS provides complete software solutions on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. Organizations "rent" an application (e.g. Salesforce), and users use it over the Internet, generally through a web browser. 

All operations and maintenance tasks, and application data, are handled by the service provider.

### Problem it Addresses

Traditionally, business software is installed on individual computers, requiring an admin to maintain and update. This can be limiting when different departments need to collaborate, work from a communal database, or update data continuously. 

An organization may use on-premise software for customer relationship management (CRM). This software needs to be evaluated, purchased, installed, secured, maintained, and regularly upgraded by the internal IT department, placing a burden on the IT team. The cost associated with licenses, installation, and potentially additional dedicated servers can become prohibitive. It can also be difficult to respond to demand and [scale](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/scalability.md) up and down as needed quickly in response to growth or change.

### How it Helps
SaaS applications work out-of-the-box. SaaS is ready-to-use software that is installed, maintained, upgraded, and secured by the vendor. It can easily scale up and down by adding more users or capacity and, with its pay-as-you-go model, it can be an affordable way for organizations to leverage enterprise applications.
