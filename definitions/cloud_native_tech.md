## Cloud Native Technology

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. They uphold the ‘promise of the cloud’ and leverage cloud computing benefits to their fullest. Designed from the ground up to exploit the capabilities of cloud computing, containers, service meshes, microservices, and immutable infrastructure exemplify this approach.

There are often many downsides to traditional models of IT operation, some of which may be more prevalent than others. Traditional systems are: hard to scale; not fault-tolerant; not self-healing; inefficient due to poor utilisation of resources; the list goes on.

Cloud native technologies enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil. Desirable traits of cloud-native systems are easier to achieve with the cloud native stack.
