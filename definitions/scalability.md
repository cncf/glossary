## Scalability

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

Scalability is the property of a system to be responsive in the presence of load.

A system's responsiveness, that is, its ability to meet its service level objectives, is a function of load and failure. Increased presence of load or an increased presence of failure leads to a decrease of responsiveness.

Scalability ensures a system is responsive in the presence of load. However, Scalability does not ensure a system is responsive in the presence of failure (See Reliability)
