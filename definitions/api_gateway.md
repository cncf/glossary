## API Gateway

**Status:** Completed

An API gateway is a tool that aggregates together the APIs of many other applications, making them all available in one place. Typically API gateways are used with web services, and some API gateways may provide additional functionality beyond simply providing access to the backing web services.

API gateways provide one single access point, meaning that security teams need only worry about one ‘front door’, and clients need only know about one address. 

By providing a single access point for requests to all web services in a system, an API gateway can simplify operational concerns like security and observability. As all requests flow through the API gateway, it presents a simple, single place to add cross-cutting functionality such as metrics-gathering, rate-limiting, and authorization (using schemes such as OAuth).
