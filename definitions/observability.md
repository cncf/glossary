## Observability

Observability is a measure of how a system's state, or status, can be understood from its external outputs. Computers systems can be measured by observing CPU time, memory, disk space, latency, errors, etc. The information pulled explains how the system is performing, although these metrics can be interpreted differently by different users. Users will infer unique interpretations from the same data of a system. The more aligned and more correct these interpretations are, the more observable a system is.

Like most control systems, users rely on system outputs to diagnose or interpret its state. If users cannot interpret a system's state, it won't be easy to take corrective action during an incident. The longer a system is inoperative, the more expensive the system is.

The observability of a system has a significant impact on its cost. Observable systems yield meaningful, actionable data to their users, leading to more favorable outcomes and less downtime. More information does not always mean more observable, and decision-makers should consider the tools and metrics that are feeding information for their decisions.
