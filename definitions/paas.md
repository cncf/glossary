## PaaS

### What it is
A platform as a service, or PaaS, is an external platform for application development teams to deploy and run their apps. Heroku, Cloud Foundry, App Engine are examples of PaaS offerings.

### Problem it Addresses
To take advantage of cloud native patterns like [microservices](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/microservices.md) or [distributed applications](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/distributed_apps.md), operations teams and developers need to be able to offload a significant amount of operations and maintenance work. These include tasks like provisioning infrastructure, handling [service discovery](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/service_discovery.md) and load balancing, and [scaling](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/scalability.md) applications.

### How it Helps
A PaaS provides common infrastructure tools to application developers in a fully automated fashion. It allows developers to understand and worry less about infrastructure and devote more time and effort to writing application code. It also provides some monitoring and [observability](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/observability.md) to help application teams ensure their apps are healthy.
