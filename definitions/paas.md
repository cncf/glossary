## PaaS

### What it is

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a [cloud computing](cloud_computing.md) model where a third-party provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure and delivers them to users over the internet. Usually, these tools are needed for application development. It is like renting a car, you're not investing the time, money, or customization into it as you would in a car you own, but you're still the one driving it and paying for gas. As a result, PaaS frees developers from installing in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.

### The problem it addresses

It doesn't typically replace a business's entire IT infrastructure for software development. Instead, it usually incorporates various underlying cloud infrastructure components, like operating systems, servers, databases, middleware, networking equipment, and storage services. All are owned, operated, configured, and maintained by the service provider, not the business. The business just provided data and the application. Users most frequently access the offerings through a web browser. PaaS usually operates on a per-use basis, making it affordable for projects, but some providers charge a flat monthly fee. PaaS offerings are usually used for mobile app and cross-platform app development, as well as [DevOps](devops.md) tools. Its primary benefit is simplicity and convenience for users - typically developers. PaaS products include AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Google App Engine.

### How it helps

It decreases infrastructure management, automates or eliminates maintenance tasks, removes the complexities of load balancing, scaling, and distributing dependent services, and allows organizations to adopt new offerings and technologies without overhauling business processes. PaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing services. The other two are a software as a service ([SaaS](saas.md)) and infrastructure as a service ([IaaS](iaas.md)). With PaaS, a provider offers more of the application stack than IaaS solutions. PaaS is often the most cost-effective and time-effective way for a developer to create a unique application.
