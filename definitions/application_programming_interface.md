## Application Programming Interface

**Status:** Completed

An application programming interface, API, is a way for computer programs to interact with each other. Just as humans interact with a web site via a web page, an API is a way to allow computer programs to interact with each other.

To allow computer programs, otherwise known as apps, to interact and share information with each other in a language that they both understand and agree upon. 

APIs are one of the building blocks for modern applications because they provide a way for apps to interact in a straightforward manner for developers. Whenever you hear about microservices working together, for example, you can infer that they are interacting with each other via an API.
