**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

The term DevSecOps refers to a cultural merger of the development, security, and operations responsibilities. It extends the DevOps approach, where operation teams provide and manage tools to increase developers' productivity to include security. DevSecOps focuses on implementing security considerations into the daily developer workflow without hampering the developers' productivity. Like DevOps, DevSecOps is a cultural shift, pushed by the technologies adopted, with unique adoption methods.  

Without DevSecOps, the development, security, and operations teams exist in silos. Each team has conflicting goals about where, when, and how to deploy infrastructure and software. DevSecOps focuses on breaking down these silos so teams can create secure, automated workflows and avoid production downtime. 

DevSecOps will help to:
  * Increase productivity from automation and communication
  * Reduce security mishaps and the cost incurred from them
  * Foster better team communication and understanding of priorities
  * Reduce friction between teams --- DevOps + Security
