## Distributed Systems

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

Distributed systems consist of small components that exist across various locations / machines that are connected under the same network. They communicate with each other in order to achieve a common goal. It is likened to how a remote team works. Regardless of where they are, the team completes tasks by collaborating from various locations and produces the same result as it would an on-site team. 

In a traditional system, scaling vertically gets expensive and time consuming as it requires constant updates to a single machine. Distributed systems allow horizontal scaling which can handle a sudden increase in workloads or resources consumption. 

In addition, having a system in one place exposes itself to risks of failure. Because of the redundancy in distributed systems, even if other machines go down, it can still keep working to produce the same result.
