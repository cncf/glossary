## Distributed Systems

### What it is
Distributed systems consist of small components that exist across various locations / machines that are connected under the same network. They communicate with each other in order to achieve a common goal. It is likened to how a remote team works. Regardless of where they are, the team completes tasks by collaborating from various locations and produces the same result as it would an on-site team. 

### Problem it Addresses
In a traditional system, scaling vertically gets expensive and time consuming as it requires constant updates to a single machine. Too many devices on the traditonal system can slow the system down and overwhelm the server.

### How it helps
To solve this, the Distributed systems approach allows horizontal scaling which can handle a sudden increase in workloads or resources consumption. In addition, having a system in one place exposes itself to risks of failure. Because of the redundancy in distributed systems, even if other machines go down, it can still keep working to produce the same result.
