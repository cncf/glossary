## Infrastructure as a Service

### What it is

Infrastructure as a service i.e. IaaS is a [cloud computing](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/cloud_computing.md) service model that offers [virtualized](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/virtualization.md) compute, storage and network resources on-demand over the internet to consumers on a pay-as-you-go cost model.
In IaaS model, cloud providers owns and operates the hardware and software, it is available in Public cloud, Private cloud and Hybrid cloud deployment options.

### Problem it addresses

Organizations struggle with effective computing resource utilization in a traditional on-premise set up. The data center has to be built for perceived peak demand. When the workload declines, computing resources would be idle. When the workload spikes beyond the perceived demand, there is shortage of computing resources to process the workload. This lack of scalability leads to increased cost and lack of effective resource utilization.

### How it helps

Organizations no longer need to purchase and manage its own equipment's and the physical space required to host the equipment, it is both costly and labor intensive in a traditional on-premise set up.  With infrastructure being made available on demand by cloud providers, it brings the following benefits.
 - Saves time and cost of provisioning and scaling new development and test environments, helps developers to experiment and innovate.
 - Gives flexibility to scale up or down IT resources based on demand.
 - Reduces the need for high upfront CAPEX
