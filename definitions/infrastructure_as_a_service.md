## Infrastructure as a Service

### What it is

Infrastructure as a service i.e. IaaS is a [cloud computing](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/cloud_computing.md) service model that offers either [physical](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/bare_metal_machine.md) or [virtualized](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/virtualization.md) compute, storage, and network resources on-demand over the internet to consumers on a pay-as-you-go cost model. In the IaaS model, cloud providers own and operate the hardware and software, it is available in public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud deployment options. 

### Problem it addresses

Organizations often struggle with effective computing resource utilization in a traditional on-premise setup. The data center has to be built for perceived peak demand. When the workload declines, computing resources would be idle. When the workload spikes beyond the perceived demand, there is a shortage of computing resources to process the workload. This lack of scalability leads to increased cost and a lack of effective resource utilization.

### How it helps

IaaS allows organizations to avoid purchasing and maintaining compute and data center space for a given application. On demand infrastructure allows an organization to rent access to compute on an on demand basis. This allows them to defer large capital expenditures, or [CAPEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure), while giving them the flexibility to scale up or down as needed. IaaS offerings reduce the upfront costs of experimenting or trying a new application and provide facilities to rapidly deploy infrastructure. This can make a cloud provider an excellent option for providing development or test environments, which helps developers to experiment and innovate.
