## Vertical Scaling

### What it is

The ability for an application to scale, typically by adding CPU and memory as the workload increases. Also known as “scale up”, this refers to adding resources to a single node.

### Problem it Addresses

As demand for an application grows beyond the current capacity of that application instance, we need to find a way to scale (add capacity to) the system. We can either add more compute resources to existing nodes (vertical scaling) or more nodes to the system ([horizontal scaling](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/horizontal_scaling.md)). [Scalability](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/scalability.md) contributes to competitiveness, efficiency, reputation, and quality.


### How it helps

Vertical scaling allows you to resize your server with no change to your code. It is the ability to increase the capacity of an existing application by adding compute resources.
