## Vertical Scaling

### What it is

Vertical scaling, also known as "scaling up and down", is a technique where a system's capacity is increased by adding CPU and memory to individual [nodes](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/nodes.md) as the workload increases. Let's say, you have a computer of 4GB RAM and want to increase its capacity to 16GB RAM, scaling it vertically means switching to a 16GB RAM system. (Please refer to [horizontal scaling](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/horizontal_scaling.md) for a different scaling approach.)

### Problem it Addresses

As demand for an application grows beyond the current capacity of that application instance, we need to find a way to scale (add capacity to) the system. We can either add more compute resources to existing nodes (vertical scaling) or more nodes to the system ([horizontal scaling](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/horizontal_scaling.md)). [Scalability](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/scalability.md) contributes to competitiveness, efficiency, reputation, and quality.


### How it helps

Vertical scaling allows you to resize your server with no change to your code. It is the ability to increase the capacity of an existing application by adding compute resources.
