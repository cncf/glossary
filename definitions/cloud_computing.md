## Cloud Computing

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

Cloud computing is a method to offer and deliver services over the internet. Cloud computing gives users the ability to access and use computing power in a remote physical location. The types of services delivered over the cloud can include software, data storage, networking resources, analytic tools, databases, and more. There are countless cloud locations and services available, allowing organizations to determine how to distribute their workloads. . The principal types of cloud computing architectures are public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and community cloud.

Before the arrival of cloud computing, organizations had to set up large IT departments and physical infrastructure on premise, called data centers. Any significant form of upgrade or revamp came with problems such as large costs, time and resource allocations, and downtime for the organizationâ€™s websites. The physical system restricted operational access from remote locations. Without proper backup mechanisms in place, organizations also faced the danger of losing all data in the event of a crisis or natural calamity.

Cloud computing allows enterprises to reduce the need for big IT infrastructure set-ups within organizations. organizations can focus more on business operations since all IT needs, including hardware and software upgrades, are taken care of by the cloud provider. The need-based service structure of cloud computing allows for great cost-efficiency, flexibility, and scalability. Cloud environments are normally set up with dedicated servers in highly secure data centers with proper backups in place. This makes businesses run smoothly even in the event of a crisis.
