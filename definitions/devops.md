## DevOps

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

Organizations have increasingly embraced modern software development practices, public cloud infrastructure, and cloud-native technologies and applications. DevOps, short for development operations, is the cultural change driven by adopting these new technologies. DevOps aims to break the barrier between developers and operations teams during the typical IT data center lifecycle. New technologies, such as containers, enable developers to "write once, run anywhere" and shift code execution to developers, thus, freeing operations teams to focus on scalability, security, and automation of day-to-day enablement of developer workflows. 

Applications need infrastructure to run, and the previously slow-moving pace of infrastructure setup hampered developers' ability to create new functionality quicker. When environments are not set up correctly, developers waste time debugging and communicating with operations for the correct environment.

By giving developers the ability to write and execute application code anywhere without back-and-forth to operations teams can shift their focus to other responsibilities. Operations can focus on scalability, security, and other tasks to enable application growth. Developers can give more structured feedback to operations about how the application should perform.
