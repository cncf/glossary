## Autoscaling

Applications require scaling in order to meet the fluctuating demand of their users. Autoscaling is an automated method for the scaling of said applications. The autoscaling process varies and can be configured to scale based on different metrics, such as memory or process time. 

Previously, infrastructure and applications were architected to consider peak system usage. This architecture meant that more resources were underutilized and inelastic to changing consumer demand. The inelasticity meant higher costs to the business and lost business from outages due to overdemand.

By virtualizing and containerizing applications and their dependencies, they can scale according to their demand. Organizations can monitor their application demand and automatically scale them based on their needs to give the best user experience.
