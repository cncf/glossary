## Cluster

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

A cluster is a group of computers or software services that work together towards some common goal. In the context of cloud native computing the term is most often applied to Kubernetes, whereby a cluster is a set of services often running on different computers that allow the user to run workloads in containers, without having to worry about exactly how and where those workloads run. Other systems run in clusters too, such as databases and message queues.

If software runs on one single computer then it present a single point of failure - if that computer crashes, or the cleaner accidentally unplugs the power cable, then some business-critical system may be taken offline.

By running across multiple machines, clustered, distributed systems avoid having a single point of failure. Authoring distributed systems is difficult and a discipline of computer science in its own right - hence why it is only now due to the necessity of global systems and after years of trial and error do Cloud Native Technologies present the building blocks to make the operation and creation of distributed systems easier.
