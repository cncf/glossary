## Cluster

### What it is

A cluster is a group of computers or applications that work together towards a common goal. In the context of cloud native computing, the term is most often applied to Kubernetes. A Kubernetes cluster is a set of services (or workloads) that run in their own containers, usually on different machines. The collection of all these containerized services, connected over a network, represent a cluster.

### The problem it addresses 

Software that runs on a single computer presents a single point of failure — if that computer crashes, or someone accidentally unplugs the power cable, then some business-critical system may be taken offline. That's why modern software is generally built as [distributed applications](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/distributed_apps.md), grouped together as clusters. 

### How it helps

Clustered, distributed applications run across multiple machines, eliminating a single point of failure. But building distributed systems is really hard. In fact, it's a computer science discipline in its own right. The need for global systems and years of trial and error led to the development of a new kind of tech stack: [cloud native technologies](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/cloud_native_tech.md). These new technologies are the building blocks that make the operation and creation of distributed systems easier.
