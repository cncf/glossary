## SaaS

### What it is
Software as a [service](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/service.md) (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based services over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Gmail, Amazon Web Services, GitHub, Slack). SaaS provides a complete software solution that you can purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You can rent the use of an application for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and application data are located in the service provider’s data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.

### Problem it Addresses
Traditional business software is installed on individual computers and takes an admin to maintain and update. It can limit businesses when different departments need to collaborate, work from a communal database, or update data on a continuous basis. To use sales and marketing as an example, a business may use an on-premises software for customer relationship management (CRM). This software needs to be evaluated, bought, installed, kept secure, maintained and regularly upgraded on in-house systems by the internal IT department. Using packaged software places a burden on the IT team which can turn into a bottleneck for projects. A business can end up needing to support a wide variety of systems side by side, but find it tricky to integrate them as they are coded and built differently. This approach also presents upfront costs for software and licences and potentially servers for the software to sit on. The costs of the CRM software and hardware might mean it is not affordable for small businesses. It can be difficult to respond to demand and [scale](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/definitions/scalability.md) up and down as needed quickly in response to growth or change.

### How it Helps
To provide SaaS applications to users, you don’t need to purchase, install, update, or maintain any hardware, middleware, or software. SaaS makes even sophisticated enterprise applications, such as ERP and CRM, affordable for organizations that lack the resources to buy, deploy, and manage the required infrastructure and software themselves. With Software as a Service, you are tapping into a system that is ready to use, as it is installed, maintained, upgraded and kept secure by the vendor. If you need to add additional users as your business grows you should be able to do this simply and quickly. As you only pay for what you need, it can be a very cost effective solution for all sizes of business.
