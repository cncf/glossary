## Horizontal Scaling

### What it is
In cloud computing perspective Horizonatal Scaling means adding additional instances instead of moving into a larger instance size. It is an approach to enhance the perfomance of the server node by adding new instances of the server to already existing servers in order to distribute the workload equally. It basically aims to decrease the server's load rather than expanding capacity of the individual server.

Load balancing, clustering, and distributed file systems are some of the cruicial and popular stratergies of horizontal scaling. It caters to portioning of data where each node contains single part of the data.

### Problem it addresses
With growing demands of the application the system should be able to scale by increasing/growing/managing the resources for the customers using it. The latency of the API calls might increase due to heavy traffic, this is the problem that can be solved by horizontal scaling.

### How it helps
Horizontal scaling helps as it can provide limitless scaling with endless additions to server instances. It enhances the I/O concurrency, and also reduces the load on existing nodes and expands disk capacity.
