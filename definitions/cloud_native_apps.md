## Cloud Native Apps

**Status:** Feedback Appreciated

Cloud native applications are specifically designed to take advantage of cloud computing models while keeping it independent of any particular cloud stack. It provides consistent deployment as they are optimized to run across public, on-premises and hybrid clouds. Cloud native applications are intended to be scaled with speed and agility as business systems constantly evolve.

The two main classes of applications are stateful and stateless, which have very different requirements for production readiness. Most importantly being how both the state and the data are protected and preserved.  In the early years of Kubernetes, the platform primarily supported and ran stateless applications, defined as applications that do not need to retain data from one session to the next when containers are restarted. With the growing adoption and community contribution of Kubernetes, it has evolved as one of the leading platforms for every type of application, including the deployment and management of scalable and highly available stateful applications.

There is no “one size fits all” path to cloud native applications as it varies by organization and the different priorities when they begin to modernize their existing application architecture and infrastructure to evolve with cloud native principles. Cloud native applications need to be portable across environments, which is why they rely on containers instead of specific cloud APIs. Compared to legacy applications, there can be hurdles when running and deploying cloud native applications  in production. 

Cloud native applications are on the rise. The evolution of cloud computing has been remarkable, resulting not only in a rapidly growing market and innovation, but also in shifting mindsets and practices pointing toward a new IT operating model and software development paradigm for DevOps and Microservices. Evolving toward cloud native application development and delivery is multifaceted, affecting aspects throughout the organization including culture, processes, architecture, and technology. Decide whether to build or buy a Kubernetes platform.
