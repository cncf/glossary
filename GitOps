What it is
GitOps is a set of principles for operating and managing software systems. In GitOps, environment specifics are defined, or "declared," in a repository with the application code â€” your so-called system of record.

Problem it addresses
Configuration management often via YAML or JSON files becomes unwieldy at scale. In large organizations, thousands of developers making  frequent code changes these files can exponentially grow.

How it helps
A GitOps approach provides a complete history of how environments have been modified over time. Configurations are stored in Git repositories. That allows operators to revert to a previous state if needed, significantly easing error recovery.
