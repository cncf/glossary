From a cloud native perspective, reliability refers to how well a system responds to failures. 
If we have a [distributed system](/distributed-systems/) that keeps working as infrastructure changes and individual components fail, it is reliable. 
On the other hand, if it fails easily and operators need to intervene manually to keep it running, it is unreliable. 
The goal of [cloud native applications](/cloud-native-apps/) is to build inherently reliable systems.
