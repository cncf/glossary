From a cloud native perspective, reliability refers to how well a system responds to failures. 
If we have a [distributed system](/distributed-systems/) that keeps working as infrastructure changes and individual components fail, it is reliable. 
On the other hand, if it fails easily and operators need to intervene manually to keep it running, it is unreliable. 
The goal of [cloud native applications](/cloud-native-apps/) is to build inherently reliable systems.

## In sign language

While each country has its own sign language, we'd like to standardize signs as much as possible for new cloud native terms. When a cloud native term is composed of words that already exist in English, we'll use American Sign Language (ASL).
