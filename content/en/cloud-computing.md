Cloud computing offers CPU power, storage, and network capabilities over the internet, 
enabling scalable and flexible access to resources across global data centers. 
It spans private clouds, dedicated to single organizations for security and control, 
and public clouds, open for widespread use, optimizing cost and scalability.

## Problem it addresses

Traditionally, organizations needing more computing capacity had to choose between costly investments in new server facilities or upgrades to existing infrastructure, a slow and resource-heavy process.

## How it helps

Organizations can use cloud computing to rent computing resources on demand without the burden of managing physical infrastructure. 
This strategy has two main advantages:
- It removes the delays and expenses of establishing new infrastructure so organizations can concentrate on their core business.
- Organizations can [scale](https://github.com/ronitblenz/glossary/blob/cloud_computing/content/en/scalability.md) their resources up or down based on demand, aligning infrastructure with business needs.
Thus, cloud computing provides an efficient way for organizations to access necessary infrastructure flexibly and economically without excess commitment.
