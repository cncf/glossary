## What it is

Cloud computing offers compute resources like CPU, network, and disk capabilities on-demand over the internet, allowing users to access and use computing power in a remote physical location. 
We generally differentiate between private and public cloud, depending on whether the cloud infrastructure is exclusively dedicated to an organization or shared for open public services.

## Problem it addresses

Organizations traditionally faced two main challenges when attempting to expand computing power. 
They could either acquire, support, and design (new) facilities to host their physical servers and network or expand and maintain existing ones. 
Cloud computing solves that challenge by allowing organizations to outsource some of their computing needs. 

## How it helps

Cloud providers allow organizations to rent compute resources on-demand and pay for usage, delivering two key benefits.
First, organizations can focus on their product or service without waiting, planning, and spending resources on new physical infrastructure. And second, they can simply [scale](/scalability/) on-demand as needed.
Cloud computing allows organizations to adopt as much or as little infrastructure as they need.
