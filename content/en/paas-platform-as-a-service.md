Platform as a Service (PaaS) can be thought of as a pre-built development environment in the cloud. 
It provides everything you need to build and run your applications, from the underlying infrastructure 
such as servers, storage and tools for development and deployment. Essentially, you rent the resources you need instead 
of managing them yourself, allowing you to focus on creating your application.



## Problem it addresses

PaaS tackles the challenge of setting up and maintaining the complex environment needed to develop applications. 
By offering a pre-built environment, it eliminates the need for companies to spend time and resources on managing servers,
storage, and development tools. This allows them to focus their efforts on what truly matters - creating innovative and 
creative applications.
 

## How it helps

PaaS simplifies application development. Imagine having an entire workshop ready to use, with all the tools and 
benches laid out. PaaS provides that for developers, eliminating the need to set up the groundwork themselves. 
This allows them to focus their time and energy on what they do best: building great applications.
