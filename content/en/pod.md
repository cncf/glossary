Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and managed in [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/). In fact its smallest unit which can be scheduled by the Kubernetes Scheduler

It is a group of one or more [containers](/container/), with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.
