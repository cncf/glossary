## What it is

Configuration management is a way of how the devops engineers or administrators manages the configuration of servers or infrastructure. It can also be defined as a set of practices and processes used to manage and control the configuration of software, hardware, and other components in a systematic manner. It involves maintaining accurate and up-to-date information about the various elements and their relationships within a system or product throughout its lifecycle.

## Problem it addresses

The problem that configuration management addresses is the complexity and challenges associated with managing the configuration of complex systems. It aims to solve the problem of manageing multiple servers. As systems grow in size and complexity, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of the different components, their versions, dependencies, and interrelationships. Without proper configuration management, organizations may encounter issues such as version conflicts, software inconsistencies, and difficulties in reproducing and deploying system configurations.

## How it helps

Configuration management helps organizations by providing a centralized and organized approach to managing configurations. It allows them to track and control changes to the system, understand the impact of changes, assess risks, and make informed decisions. Configuration management also enables the establishment of baselines or snapshots of the system, which serve as reference points for auditing, troubleshooting, and compliance purposes. Additionally, it facilitates version control, ensuring that the correct versions of components are used in different environments and reducing the risk of compatibility issues.
