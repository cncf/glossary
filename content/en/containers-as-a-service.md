## What it is

Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) is a cloud service that helps manage and deploy apps 
using [container](/container/)-based [abstraction](/abstraction/). 
This service can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. 

CaaS providers offer a framework or orchestration platform that 
automates key IT functions on which containers are deployed and managed. 
It helps developers build secure and [scalable](/scalability/) containerized apps. 
Because users only buy the resources they need (scheduling capabilities, load balancing, etc.), 
they save money and increase efficiency. 
Containers create consistent environments to rapidly develop and 
deliver [cloud-native applications](/cloud-native-apps/) that can run anywhere. 

## Problem it addresses

Without CaaS, software development teams need to deploy, manage, and monitor 
the underlying infrastructure that containers run on. 

## How it helps

When deploying containerized applications to a CaaS platform, 
users gain visibility into system performance through log aggregation and monitoring tools. 
CaaS also includes built-in functionality for [auto scaling](/auto-scaling/) and orchestration management. 
It enables teams to build high visibility and high availability [distributed systems](/distributed-systems/). 
In addition, by allowing rapid deployments, CaaS increases team development velocity. 
While containers ensure a consistent deployment target, 
CaaS lowers engineering operating costs 
by reducing needed [DevOps](/devops/) resources needed to manage a deployment.
