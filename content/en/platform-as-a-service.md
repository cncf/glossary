Platform as a Service (PaaS) can be thought of as a pre-built development environment in the cloud. 
It provides everything you need to build and run your applications, from the underlying infrastructure 
such as servers, storage and tools for development and deployment. Essentially, you rent the resources you need instead 
of managing them yourself, allowing you to focus on creating your application.



## Problem it addresses

PaaS (Platform as a Service) addresses the complexities of setting up and maintaining a development environment by providing
a pre-built platform. This eliminates the need for companies to manage servers, storage, and development tools, 
allowing them to focus on building innovative applications. PaaS often leverages IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) or 
bare metal to allocate dedicated infrastructure resources.

By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, PaaS offers a simplified interface for developers. 
This abstraction allows companies to focus on application development without being burdened by the intricacies of 
managing the underlying technology. PaaS provides a scalable and flexible environment, enabling businesses to easily adapt 
to changing demands and grow their applications as needed.
 

## How it helps

PaaS simplifies application development. Imagine having an entire workshop ready to use, with all the tools and 
benches laid out. PaaS provides that for developers, eliminating the need to set up the groundwork themselves. 
This allows them to focus their time and energy on what they do best: building great applications.
