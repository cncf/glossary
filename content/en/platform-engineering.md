Platform engineering is the art of building tools and processes that empower software developers.  
It's like creating a self-service station specifically designed to meet developers' needs throughout the 
software creation journey. By providing these tools and workflows, platform engineering helps developers 
to work faster and more efficiently.

## Problem it addresses

Platform engineering tackles the challenge of slow and inefficient software development. 
In the past, developers often spent a significant amount of time on repetitive tasks like setting up 
environments or configuring tools. Platform engineering streamlines these processes, 
allowing developers to focus on the core task of writing innovative code. 

## How it helps

Platform engineering tackles the issue of inefficient software development by providing developers with a pre-built toolkit.
This toolkit includes tools and automated processes that streamline common tasks. In essence, it eliminates the 
need for developers to spend time on repetitive setup or configuration, 
allowing them to focus on what matters most: Writing more innovative code.
