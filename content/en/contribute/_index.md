All the content for the Cloud Native Glossary is stored in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/cncf/glossary).  You'll find there a list of [issues](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues), [PRs](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/pulls), and [discussions](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/discussions) about the glossary.

## General guidelines
To propose specific changes to a glossary entry, edit that entry in your branch and issue a pull request. To request that an entry be clarified, updated, or reconsidered, you may alternatively open an issue. To propose a new entry to the glossary, either create an issue or, if you have the definition drafted, add the entry to your branch (in its proper alphabetical location) and create a pull request.


## Issues

Please jump in and help us out by reviewing [open issues](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues) and making pull requests to resolve them.  The easiest ones to contribute to have been marked with the “good first issue” or “help wanted” tags.  Some have already been assigned to people.

Please title your pull requests appropriately, summing up what your commits are about. Also, please raise separate pull requests for each entry as this makes it easier to discuss and shepherd updates in self-contained units.  Please provide links to third-party uses that support your issue or pull request.  After successfully submitting your PR, you should see it here:

Please see the [Style Guide](/style-guide) for information on the format and style of glossary entries.
