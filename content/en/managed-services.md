## What it is

A managed service is a software offering where operations and management are taken care of by a third party. 
Examples include database as a service offerings like Amazonâ€™s RDS or an external monitoring service like Datadog.

## Problem it addresses

Managing software is complex, especially considering all the different technologies that make up a modern stack. 
Managing each aspect of it and/or having in-house experts able to do so may be too expensive or not worth your engineers' time. 
Your team is likely better off building new capabilities than taking care of the operational tasks that can be easily outsourced.

## How it helps

Managed services are ready to use from day one with very little operational overhead. 
They allow organizations to effectively outsource tasks that fall outside of their core competency 
with well defined, and usually [API](/application-programming-interface/) driven, boundaries.
