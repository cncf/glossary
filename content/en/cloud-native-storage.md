Cloud native storage is a specialized storage technology tailored to meet the demands of cloud native environments.
It offers data storage solutions optimized for containerized applications running on platforms like
[Kubernetes](/kubernetes/) or other cloud-native infrastructures. A cloud native storage platform primarily caters
to [stateful applications](/stateful-apps/), which rely on persistent data storage. 

## Problem it addresses

Traditional storage systems often struggle to grow with increasing demand. 
They can be complicated to manage, slow to handle large amounts of data, and inefficient with resources. 
Older systems may also have trouble connecting with modern applications, leading to slow processes and scattered data. 
Manual scaling and maintenance further increase downtime and operational costs. 
These limitations make it difficult for businesses to adapt to evolving technology needs quickly.

## How it helps

Cloud native storage solves these problems by offering flexible scaling, easier management, and faster data access. 
It automatically increases or decreases storage based on demand, reducing manual work and improving performance. 
With built-in caching and [distributed systems](/distributed-systems/), it ensures quick data retrieval. 
Pay-as-you-go pricing helps control costs while easily integrating with modern applications for smooth and efficient data management. 
Enhanced security features also protect sensitive data, and built-in automation reduces the risk of human error in storage operations.
