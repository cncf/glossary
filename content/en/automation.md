***Automation is a term for technology applications where human input is minimized.***

TYPES OF AUTOMATION SYSTEMS

1. FIXED AUTOMATION
Also referred to as hard automation, fixed automation systems carry out a single set of tasks without deviation. Because of its function, this type of system would typically be used for discrete mass production and continuous flow systems. 
 
2. PROGRAMMABLE AUTOMATION
As the names suggests, programmable automation runs through commands delivered by a computer program. This means that the resulting processes can vary widely with changing instructions given to the computer through a series of code. 

3. FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION
Also referred to as soft automation, this type of automation is utilized in computer-controlled flexible manufacturing systems and allows for a more flexible production. 

4. INTEGRATED AUTOMATION
Integrated automation involves the total automation of manufacturing plants as it is entirely handled by computers and control processes with minimal human involvement. Computers can design the necessary parts, test the designs, and fabricate the parts. Integrated automation, like flexible automation, is compatible with both batch process manufacturing and continuous process manufacturing.

**Problem it addresses**
Automation helps administrators and operators manage environments by automating previously manual operations.
