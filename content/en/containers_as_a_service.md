## What it is
Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) is a cloud service that helps manage and deploy apps using [container](/container/) based [abstraction](/abstraction/). CaaS can be deployed on-premises or in a cloud. The provider offers the framework, or the orchestration platform, on which the containers are deployed and managed, and itâ€™s through this orchestration that key IT functions are automated. CaaS is especially useful to developers in building containerized apps that are more secure and also [scalable](/scalibility/). Users can buy only the resources they want (scheduling capabilities, load balancing, etc.), saving money and increasing efficiency. Containers create consistent environments to rapidly develop and deliver [cloud-native applications](/cloud_native_apps/) that can run anywhere. 

## Problem it addresses
Without CaaS, software development teams need to deploy, manage, and monitor the underlying infrastructure that containers run on. 

## How it helps
Deploying containerized applications to a CaaS platform enables transparency into the performance of a system through tools like log aggregation and monitoring. CaaS also includes built in functionality for [auto scaling](/auto_scaling/) and orchestration management. It enables teams to rapidly build high visibility and high availability [distributed systems](/distributed_systems/). In addition, CaaS increases team development velocity by enabling rapid deployments. Using containers insures a consistent deployment target while CaaS can lower engineering operating costs by reducing the [DevOps](/devops/) resources needed to manage a deployment.
