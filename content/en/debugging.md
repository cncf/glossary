## What it is
Debugging is the process or activity of finding and resolving bugs (or errors) from computer programs, software, or systems to get the desired result. A bug is a defect or a problem leading to incorrect or unexpected result.

## Problem it addresses
Software development is a complex activity which makes it nearly impossible to write code without introducing bugs. Those bugs lead to code that will likely not function as desired (undefined behavior) when executed. Depending on how critical an application is, bugs can have a huge negative impact, financially or even for human lives. Usually application code has to go through different stages or environments where it gets tested. The more critical an application is, the more accurate the testing has to be. 

## How it helps
When bugs appear anywhere, engineers will have to debug (which means finding and fixing) in order to decrease undesired behavior for production systems. Debugging is no easy task as engineers have to track down the source of the undesired behavior.  It not only requires knowledge about the code itself but also knowledge about the execution context at runtime. This is were different debugging techniques and tools come in handy. Analysis of logs, traces, and metrics, for instance, are used for debugging directly in production. In contrast to that, developers can use interactive the source code during the programming phase. Interactive debugging lets developers step through the code at runtime while they can analyse the related execution context. Once they have identified the source of the failure, they can correct the code and create a bug fix or patch.
