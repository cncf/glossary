## What it is
Debugging is the process or activity of finding and resolving bugs (or errors) from computer programs, software, or systems to get the desired result. A bug is a defect or a problem leading to incorrect or unexpected result.

## Problem it addresses
Software development is a complex activity which makes it nearly impossible to write code without introducing bugs. Those bugs lead to code that will likely not function as desired (undefined behavior) when executed. Depending on how critical an application is, bugs can have a huge negative impact, financially or even for human lives. Usually application code has to go through different stages or environments where it gets tested. The more critical an application is, the more accurate the testing has to be. 

## How it helps
Debugging tools use various debugging techniques to help developers identify bugs. How these tools are used depends on the development stage. Analysis of logs, traces, and metrics, for instance, are used for debugging directly in production without requiring program execution to stop. Developers use interactive debugging on the source code during the programming phase. By running the program and connecting an external debugger tool, developers control the flow of the program and instruct it to pause the execution at specific points where they suspect the error may happen; they usually get this information by reading the logs. Once they have identified the source of the failure, they can correct the code and create a bug fix or patch.
