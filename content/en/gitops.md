GitOps is a set of best practices for managing software systems  
from the beginning of the development workflow, all the way to deployment
based on [shared (OpenGitOps) principles](https://opengitops.dev/).

GitOps requires the desired state or configuration of the system to 
be stored in a source control system like Git.
These practices are then used to execute a cohesive workflow that 
leverages a source control system like Git as the “single source of truth” and 
extends this practice to applications, infrastructure, and operational procedures.

## Problem it addresses

Existing processes for configuration management can face 
challenges such as configuration drift, failed deployments, inconsistency 
across different infrastructure, or unknown development history.
Emphasizing on continuous reconciliation, 
a GitOps workflow can help alleviate these issues, 
among several others.

## How it helps

GitOps is a paradigm that can be applied to a workflow 
to help manage an application and cloud system infrastructure. 
Moreover, it helps organizations to manage the entire infrastructure 
and application development and deployment lifecycle using a 
single and unified tool.

GitOps brings organizations several other advantages 
such as transparency and traceability of changes, 
reliability and security through declarative states,
and rollback, revert and self-healing attributes.
