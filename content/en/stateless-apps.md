Stateless applications handle each request independently without remembering any previous interactions or user data.
Data from previous interactions is referred to as state since that data isnâ€™t stored anywhere, these apps are state*less*. 
Here's an example: 
When you use a search engine, and that search is interrupted (e.g., the window is closed), those search results are lost. 
You'll need to start all over.

On the other hand, applications that process requests while considering previous interactions are called [stateful applications](/stateful-apps/).
