Stateless applications process requests as if each request were the first it's ever been sent. 
The app doesn't "remember" previous interactions or user session data. 
Data from previous interactions is referred to as state, and since that data isn't stored anywhere, these apps are state*less*. 
Here's an example: 
When you use a search engine, and that search is interrupted (e.g., the window is closed), those search results are lost. 
You'll need to start all over.

On the other hand, applications that process requests while considering previous interactions are called [stateful applications](/stateful-apps/).
