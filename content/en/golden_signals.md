## What it is
Golden signals contain a set of criteria that provide a wide view of a service from a user’s perspective . It is the gold standard for monitoring a web application’s performance.

## Problem it addresses
Old monitoring tools are much suitable as these were created to monitor machines, not microservices. On the other hand, most of the modern monitoring systems offer a huge variety of parameters for various purposes, making it easy to drown in and lose focus of what really is relevant for the application.

## How it helps
It helps in detecting issues present in a microservices application by offering essential service measurement parameters such as :

Latency : To measure the time between when a request is made and when it is completed. The less latency, the better.

Traffic : To measure the demand users as a whole put on the application.

Error : To measure the rate of errors returned by the application.

Saturation : To measure the utilization of the application.
