## What it is
Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. To explain further, it is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

## Problem it addresses
If you are a graphic or web designer (literally everyone who writes code) and want to keep every version of an image or layout, a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

## How it helps
Version control helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency. It allows us to have the entire project data to be stored in a repository and the software teams can track changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration between team members.
