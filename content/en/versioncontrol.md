## What it is
Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. To explain further, it is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

## Problem it addresses
Before Version control, changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible with those made by another developer working at the same time. And, it is more like developing a software without backups. Now, If you are a developer(literally everyone who writes code) and want to keep every version of the code you write, a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. Using Version control, it allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.

## How it helps
Version control helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency. It allows us to have the entire project data to be stored in a repository and the software teams can track changes to the code, while enhancing communication and collaboration between team members as explained above.
