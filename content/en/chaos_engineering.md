## What it is
Chaos Engineering or CE is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in production in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions.

## Problem it addresses
SREs and DevOps continuously look for new techniques to increase product resiliency and reliability. A given system's ability to tolerate failures while ensuring adequate service quality is typically specified as a requirement in software development. Deep testing on a production system is not always possible due to the complexity of the architecture. High deployment of new features to the production environment can result in a high probability of downtime and a critical incident - with considerable consequences to the business.

## How it helps
Chaos engineering is a technique to meet the resilience requirement and can be used to achieve resilience against Infrastructure failures, Network failures and Application failures. By proactive random injection of failures, it is possible to test a redundant architecture to verify that an application, infrastructure or platforms failure cannot noticeably impact customers. This approach helps increase the resiliency and confidence in the complex systems we put into production.
