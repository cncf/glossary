All the content for the Cloud Native Glossary is stored in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/cncf/glossary).  You'll find there a list of [issues](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues), [PRs](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/pulls), and [discussions](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/discussions) about the glossary.

## Issues

[Open issues](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues) can be viewed and worked on.  The easiest ones to contribute to have been marked with the “good first issue” or “help wanted” tags.  Some have already been assigned to people.
