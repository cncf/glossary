Please note that in IT, service has multiple meanings. 
In this definition, we'll focus on the more traditional one: service as in microservice. 
How or even if services differ from microservices is nuanced and different people may have different opinions. 
For a high-level definition, we'll treat them as the same. 
Please refer to the [microservices](/microservices/) definition.
