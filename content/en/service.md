Please note that in IT, service has multiple meanings. 
In this definition, we'll focus on the more traditional one: service as in microservice. 
How or even if services differ from microservices is nuanced and different people may have different opinions. 
For a high-level definition, we'll treat them as the same. 
Please refer to the [microservices](/microservices-architecture/) definition.

## In sign language

While each country has its own sign language, we'd like to standardize signs as much as possible for new cloud native terms. When a cloud native term is composed of words that already exist in English, we'll use American Sign Language (ASL).
