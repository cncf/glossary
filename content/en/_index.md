# Cloud Native Glossary

The CNCF Cloud Native Glossary Project is intended to be used as a reference for common terms used when talking about cloud native applications.

## Working With Definitions

To make it easier to work on individual terms, we’ve moved them into
individual files in the [content folder](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/tree/main/content). Each term falls under one of
three categories: 1) technology, 2) property, or 3) concept.
To learn how to navigate this GitHub page and submit issues and/
or PRs, please refer to the [how-to guide](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/how-to.md). Before submitting a PR,
please ensure you follow the [style guide](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/style-guide.md).
