# Cloud Native Glossary

## Origin
The Cloud Native Glossary is a project led by the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee (BVS). Its goal is to explain cloud native concepts in clear and simple language without requiring any previous technological knowledge.

## Contributing
Everybody is invited to suggest changes, additions, and improvements to the Cloud Native Glossary. We employ a community-driven process governed by the CNCF to develop and improve upon this shared lexicon. This Glossary provides a vendor-neutral platform to organize a shared vocabulary around cloud native technologies. Contributions are welcome from all participants who abide by the project's purpose and charter.

Anyone who wishes to make a contribution, may submit a GitHub issue or create a pull request.  For more information please see [How To Contribute](/how-to/) please ensure you follow the [Style Guide](/style-guide/).
