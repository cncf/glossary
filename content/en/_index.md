# Cloud Native Glossary

The Cloud Native Glossary aims to make the cloud native space — which is notorious for its complexity — simpler for people by making it easier to understand, 
not only for technologists but also for people on the business side. 
To achieve that, we focus on simplicity (e.g., simple language free from buzzwords, examples anyone using technology can relate to, leaving unnecessary details out). 
The Glossary is a project led by the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee (BVS).

## Contributing

Everybody is invited to suggest changes, additions, and improvements to the Cloud Native Glossary. 
We employ a community-driven process governed by the CNCF to develop and improve upon this shared lexicon. 
This Glossary provides a vendor-neutral platform to organize a shared vocabulary around cloud native technologies. 
Contributions are welcome from all participants who abide by the project's purpose and charter.

Anyone wishing to contribute may submit a GitHub issue or create a pull request.
