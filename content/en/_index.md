# Cloud Native Glossary

The Cloud Native Glossary is a project led by the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee (BVS). Its goal is to explain cloud native concepts in clear and simple language without requiring any previous technical knowledge.

## Contributing
Everybody is invited to suggest changes, additions, and improvements to the Cloud Native Glossary. We employ a community-driven process governed by the CNCF to develop and improve upon this shared lexicon. This Glossary provides a vendor-neutral platform to organize a shared vocabulary around cloud native technologies. Contributions are welcome from all participants who abide by the project's purpose and charter.

Anyone who wishes to make a contribution may submit a GitHub issue or create a pull request. Please ensure you follow the [Style Guide](/style-guide/), read the [How To Contribute](/contribute/) doc, and join the #glossary channel on the CNCF Slack. There is also a #glossary-localizations channel for those who want to help translate the glossary into their native language.
