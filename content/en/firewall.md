## What it is
A firewall is a system that filters network traffic to protect against malware and network-based threats. It can either let traffic pass or block it based on specified rules. Firewalls can be hardware, software, or a combination of the two.

## Problem it addresses
Without a firewall, any traffic can enter a network and interfere. Take a [microservices](/microservices/)-based banking app. The services are sending highly sensitive financial data over their network to communicate with one another. With no firewall, a malicious actor could enter the network, intercept communication, and inflict damage.
If a computer is not protected by a firewall, it allows unrestricted access to other networks.
This means it accepts any type of connection that is made through another person.
Anyone, even the network, can have access to our device and have complete control over it. 

## How it helps
A firewall system examines network traffic using pre-defined rules.
The traffic is subsequently filtered, and any traffic coming from untrustworthy or suspect sources is blocked.
It only accepts traffic that has been configured to accept. 
They establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted, such as Home or Work network and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet.
