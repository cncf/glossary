## What it is

A virtual private cloud is basically a managed networking service for your cloud infrastructure. You can think of it as similar to a traditional physicsl network, except it is virtualized within your cloud provider. 
VPCs have a global scope, so a single VPC can span accross multiple regions, all over the world, securely, without communicating accross the public internet.  
## Problem it addresses

There are often Security Breaches on the data hosted on public clouds due to not regular monitoring.<br>
Outdated Software leads to performance issues. <br>
At times, organizations don't exactly know how much capacity they will need, and end up overbuying to ensure they donâ€™t come up short and end up paying more space so that they don't fall short.<br> 
Users also face issues with Sync, Integration and Deployment.<br>
There is always a need to buy more hardware to extend support. Thus increasing the carbon consumption.

## How it helps

In a Virtual Private Cloud, only authenticated user can get access to the information. Moreover, VPCs are monitored for security by Cloud Security Experts regularly.<br>
VPC providers update software regularly on their end. Thus, a user always runs the latest version of the software and does not need to update it. Thus, the updated software provides better performance.<br>
Often, enterprises need to increase their capacity when they need to scale. VPC providers allow flexibility to the user to modify storage plans accordingly.<br>
VPCs allow users to manage their network spacing without any network shutdown. Giving you the flexibility to meet your needs.<br>
Virtual Clouds are always easier to sync with other clouds be it public or private. Thus, it is easier to deploy and integrate applications hosted on a Virtual Cloud.<br>
With a VPC, the data is maintained in the cloud. Thus, there is a less consumption of material resources since a separate hardware is not needed.
