## What it is

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. It allows users to do everything they are able to do on an ordinary cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider. It gives user the ability to define and control a virtual network that is isolated from all other public cloud customers, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.

## Problem it addresses

There are often Security Breaches on the data hosted on public clouds due to not regular monitoring.<br>
Outdated Software leads to performance issues. <br>
At times, organizations don't exactly know how much capacity they will need, and end up overbuying to ensure they donâ€™t come up short and end up paying more space so that they don't fall short.<br> 
Users also face issues with Sync, Integration and Deployment.<br>
There is always a need to buy more hardware to extend support. Thus increasing the carbon consumption.

## How it helps

In a Virtual Private Cloud, only authenticated user can get access to the information. Moreover, VPCs are monitored for security by Cloud Security Experts regularly.<br>
VPC providers update software regularly on their end. Thus, a user always runs the latest version of the software and does not need to update it. Thus, the updated software provides better performance.<br>
Often, enterprises need to increase their capacity when they need to scale. VPC providers allow flexibility to the user to modify storage plans accordingly.<br>
Virtual Clouds are always easier to sync with other clouds be it public or private. Thus, it is easier to deploy and integrate applications hosted on a Virtual Cloud.<br>
With a VPC, the data is maintained in the cloud. Thus, there is a less consumption of material resources thus, a separate hardware is not needed.
