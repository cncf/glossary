## What it is
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. It allows users to do everything thay are able to do on an ordinary cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider. It gives user the ability to define and control a virtual network that is isolated from all other public cloud customers, creating a private, secure place on the public cloud.

## Problem it addresses

- Security Breaches
- Performance Issues
- Overbuying or Underbuying
- Easier sync, Integration and Deployation
- High Carbon Footprint

## How it helps

- In a Virtual Private Cloud, only authenticated user can get access to the information. Moreover, VPCs are monitored for security by Cloud Security Experts regularly.
- VPC providers update softwares regularly on their end. Thus, a user always runs the latest version of the software and does not need to update it. Thus, the updated software provides better performance.
- Often, enterprises need to increase their capacity whien they need to scale. VPC providers allow flexibility to the user to modify storage plans accordingly.
- Virtual Clouds are always easier to sync with other clouds be it public or private. Thus, it is easier to deploy and integrate applications hosted on a Virtual Cloud.
- With a VPC, the data is maintained in the cloud. Thus, there is a less consumption of material resources since a separate hardware is not needed.
