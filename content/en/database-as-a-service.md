## What it is

Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) is a service managed by a [cloud](/cloud-computing/) operator (public or private) 
that supports applications without requiring the application team to 
perform traditional database administration functions. 
DBaaS allows app developers to leverage databases without being experts or 
hiring a database administrator (DBA) to keep the database up to date.

## Problem it addresses 

Traditionally, in on-premise setups, organizations regularly have to invest in 
additional storage and processing capacity to accommodate database expansion which can be expensive. 
Additionally, developers provision and configure databases with the help of IT infrastructure teams, 
slowing deployment speed of database-driven applications down. 
Loading and executing them also takes longer.

## How it helps

DBaaS allows developers to outsource all administration/administrative operations to the cloud-based service provider. 
The service provider ensures the database is running smoothly, 
including configuration management, backups, patches, upgrades, service monitoring, and more, 
with a user-friendly interface to manage it all. 
DBaaS helps organizations develop enterprise-grade applications faster while minimizing database costs.
