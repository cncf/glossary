Service level indicator (SLI) is a measure of the service level provided by a service provider to a customer.
SLI  indicates what measure of performance a customer is receiving at a given time. The term is used by Engineering teams when benchmarking the quality of service (QoS).

Traditionally, metrics used to measure the performance of a system are CPU, Memory, IO, and Network; SLIs are metrics associated with the service level. An example is the number of requests to a service, service latency, and service throughput.
