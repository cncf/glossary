## What it is
The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads on Container Orchestration Systems (COs) like Kubernetes.

## Problem it addresses
Organizations traditionally faced two main problems when attempting to expand their use of computing power. They either acquire, support, design, and pay for facilities to host their physical servers and network or expand and maintain those facilities. Cloud computing allows organizations to outsource some portion of their computing needs to another organization.

## How it helps
Cloud providers offer organizations the ability to rent compute resources on-demand and pay for usage. This allows for two major innovations: organizations can try things without wasting time planning and spending money or resources on new physical infrastructure and they can [scale](/scalability/) as needed and on-demand. Cloud computing allows organizations to adopt as much or as little infrastructure as they need.
