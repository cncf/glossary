Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework. It's a metaphor that helps frame this rework like financial debt â€” the additional effort required to add new features represents the interest paid on the debt.

Applications are continuously updated and improved, and today's technical decisions will impact tomorrow's changes. Caused by trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality, technical debt is impossible to avoid completely and can result from errors in documentation, code, automation, design, architecture, among others.
