Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution for now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. It is a part of every software development project since tradeoffs between speed, cost, and quality are impossible to avoid. Technical debts could arrive due to various defects in documentation, code, automation, design, architecture, etc. The best practices to counter technical debt include
1) Establishing proper architecture. Designing a fitting architecture for the project avoids the majority of bugs.
2)Developing automated test cases for code is an effective solution to avoid bugs.
3)Refactoring code is considered one of the best practices to avoid technical debt. Refactoring refers to the process of regularly re-writing components in a project, to remove redundancies and optimize performance.
