Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework. It's a metaphor that helps frame this rework like financial debt â€” the additional effort required to add new features represents the interest paid on the debt.

Applications are continuously updated and improved, and today's technical decisions will impact tomorrow's changes. Caused by trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality, technical debt is impossible to avoid completely and can result from errors in documentation, code, automation, design, architecture, among others. 
<!--1) Establishing proper architecture. Designing a fitting architecture for the project avoids the majority of bugs.
2)Developing automated test cases for code is an effective solution to avoid bugs.
3)Refactoring code is considered one of the best practices to avoid technical debt. Refactoring refers to the process of regularly re-writing components in a project, to remove redundancies and optimize performance.-->
