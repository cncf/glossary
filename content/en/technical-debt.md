Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework. Applications are continuously updated and improved, and today's technical decisions will impact tomorrow's changes. Caused by trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality, technical debt is impossible to avoid completely. Technical debts can result from errors in documentation, code, automation, design, architecture, etc. 
<!--1) Establishing proper architecture. Designing a fitting architecture for the project avoids the majority of bugs.
2)Developing automated test cases for code is an effective solution to avoid bugs.
3)Refactoring code is considered one of the best practices to avoid technical debt. Refactoring refers to the process of regularly re-writing components in a project, to remove redundancies and optimize performance.-->
