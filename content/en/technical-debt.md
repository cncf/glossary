## What it is
Technial debt is a concept which includes the decisions / adapted during the development phase of software.Reason for the debt to arise is, to select the non-convential method of coding for quick completion of work which could  comprise code which is messy or in an unorganized format. these decisions taken wouldn't affect initially, but in the longer run , these are factors which could lead to development of bugs, thereby leading to the decline in the quality of the product .Shortcuts and other such methods could be employed for quicker completion of work which could sort things for the moment , but it could be the same method raising conflicts and unavoidable bugs in future.
Hence the most preferable method to avoid hurdles despite time consuming , is to follow the hard way.
