## What it is
 
Middleware is a type of software that provides applications with shared services and capabilities beyond the operating system. It helps developers build applications more efficiently by making it easier to implement communication and input/output and focusing more time on building business value generating code.
 
 
## Problem it addresses 
 
Applications are deployed across multiple infrastructures, from native systems to public clouds. Architectures will vary widely. Developers area unit juggling between multiple tools, languages, and frameworks. Therefore the pressure is on to try to do it in a very cost-efficient and less timely manner.
 
 
## How it helps 

For organizations with multi-cloud and containerized environments, Middleware is used to deploy and run an application at [scale](/scalability). The purpose of Middleware is to foster a connection between different aspects of an application or between applications themselves. By leveraging Middleware, businesses can expect efficient connectivity, innovative solutions and more concise transition periods.
