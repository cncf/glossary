## What it is
 
Middleware is a type of software that provides applications with shared services and capabilities beyond the operating system. It helps developers build applications more efficiently by making it easier to implement communication and input/output and focusing more time on building business value generating code.
 
 
## Problem it addresses 
 
[Cloud native technology](/cloud_native_tech/) development brings added complexity to the development process. Developers shuffle between multiple tools, frameworks and languages also cost and time management is also a concern.  
 
 
## How it helps 
 
Developers and organizations turn to Middleware as the way to manage this complexity, also to make development quick and low-cost. Developers can build and deploy anywhere they want as it works the same thanks to Middleware running under their applications. For organizations with multi-cloud and containerized environments, Middleware is used to deploy and run apllication at [scale](/scalibilty)
