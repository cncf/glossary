## What it is
 
Middleware is a type of computer software that provides common services and capabilities to software applications outside of what's offered by the operating system. Middleware helps developers build applications more efficiently. It makes it easier for software developers to implement communications and input/output so that they focus on building the applications. 
 
 
## Problem it addresses 
 
[Cloud native technology](/cloud_native_tech/) development brings added complexity to the development process. Developers shuffle between multiple tools, frameworks and languages also cost and time management is also a concern.  
 
 
## How it helps 
 
Developers and organizations turn to Middleware as the way to manage this complexity, also to make development quick and low-cost. Developers can build and deploy anywhere they want as it works the same thanks to Middleware running under their applications. For organizations with multi-cloud and containerized environments, Middleware is used to deploy and run apllication at [scale](/scalibilty)
