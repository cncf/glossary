## What it is
A platform as a service, or PaaS, is an external platform for application development teams to deploy and run their apps. Heroku, Cloud Foundry, App Engine are examples of PaaS offerings.

## Problem it Addresses
To take advantage of cloud native patterns like [microservices](/microservices/) or [distributed applications](/distributed_apps/), operations teams and developers need to be able to offload a significant amount of operations and maintenance work. These include tasks like provisioning infrastructure, handling [service discovery](/service_discovery/) and load balancing, and [scaling](/scalability/) applications.

## How it Helps
A PaaS provides common infrastructure tools to application developers in a fully automated fashion. It allows developers to understand and worry less about infrastructure and devote more time and effort to writing application code. It also provides some monitoring and [observability](/observability/) to help application teams ensure their apps are healthy.
