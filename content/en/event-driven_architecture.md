## What it is
It is a software architecture that promotes the creation, processing, and consumption of events. An event can be seen as any change of state or other significant occurance in hardware or software. This architecture creates the structure in which events can be properly routed from their source to the desired receivers.

## Problem it addresses
As more data is becoming real time in nature, event-driven architecture allows software and services to receive and react to events in near real time, allowing for better business decisions and more reactive software.

## How it helps
Event-driven architecture establishes the producer (source) of an event and the consumer (receiver). This architecture ensures that services remain decoupled and that events are properly routed from the producer to the consumer.
