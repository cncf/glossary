## What it is

Edge computing is a [distributed system](/distributed-systems/) approach that shifts some storage and computing capacity from the primary data center to the data source.
The gathered data is computed locally (e.g., on a factory floor, in a store, or throughout a city) rather than sent to a centralized data center for processing and analysis. 
These local processing units or devices represent the system's edge, whereas the data center is its center.
The output computed at the edge is then sent back to the primary data center for further processing.
Examples of edge computing include gadgets on our wrists or computers that analyze traffic flow.
All edge devices must evaluate the data they gather and convey timely insights without transmitting it to another server environment.

## Problem it addresses

Due to the enormous amounts of data that Internet of Things (IOT)devices create, data has become the next important asset for enterprises worldwide. 
For critical business strategies,firms also increasingly need to examine the data as fast as possible, But Organisations are adjusting for the latency and performance issues.
Previously, businesses would transfer all their monitoring data to a corporate data center or the cloud for processing, analysis, and storage. However, as the IoT has expanded, the amount of data available makes this method impractical.
So, moving the computing infrastructure physically closer or next to the edge where the data creates will solve the problem of performance and latency. 
It is where edge computing comes into play.

## How it helps

IT architects have made their way back from the central data center to the logical Edge of the infrastructure, shifting storage and processing resources from the data center to the location where the data is created.
The concept of edge computing is simple; instead of delivering data to the data center, the data center migrates closer to the data. The processing and storage capacity of the data center situates as near as possible to the location of data generation (preferably in the same place).
Efficiency is the primary driver of edge computing. 
For gathering and processing data locally, edge computing places storage and servers where the data resides.
