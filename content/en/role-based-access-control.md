## What it is

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method to regulate system and resource access based on individual users' roles within an organization.
Each job function within an organization has a different role with specific permissions. 
For instance, a marketing team member may have permission to view the deals sales has in the pipeline (*read* permission) but won't be allowed to edit them (*write* permission). 
Sales and marketing have different permissions based on their roles, hence role-based access control. 

## Problem it addresses

Without RBAC, it is easy to lose track of who has access to what. Malicious actors are always in search of vulnerabilities to exploit and a mismanaged account with too many privileges can put an entire system at risk. 


## How it helps

RBAC enables granular control over user permissions within software systems. 
Depending on their roles, team members might be able only to view a section, change it, or have no access at all. 
The allocation of features to the right people prevents overprivileged accounts and unauthorized access.
