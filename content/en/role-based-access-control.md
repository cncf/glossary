## What it is

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method to regulate system and resource access based on individual users' roles within an organization.
Each job function within an organization has a different role with specific permissions. 
For instance, a marketing team member may have permission to view the deals sales has in the pipeline (*view* permission) but won't be allowed to edit them (*write* permission). 
Sales and marketing have different permissions based on their roles, hence role-based access control. 

## Problem it addresses

To maintain the security of an organization, it becomes increasingly important to limit unnecessary permissions based on employee roles.

## How it helps

It simplifies access management and enables more granular control of user actions in software applications.
The allocation of features to the right people prevents overprivileged accounts and unauthorized access.
