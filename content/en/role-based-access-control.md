## What it is

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method to regulate system and resource access based on individual user roles within an organization.
Each job function has a specific role and permissions. 
For instance, a marketing team member may have permission to view the deals sales has in the pipeline (*read* permission) but won't be allowed to edit them (*write* permission). 
Sales and marketing have different permissions based on their roles, hence role-based access control. 

## Problem it addresses

Individually managing access permissions to many users in an organization of various system resources and data is very complex considering that each user will have different set of resources the user can access. For instance, if there are 100,000 users and 1,000 resources in an organization, an administrator needs to check whether each user has authority and responsibility for each resource 100,000 times.
Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the access control according to role groups based on authority and responsibility.


## How it helps

RBAC enables granular control over user permissions within software systems. 
Depending on their roles, team members might be able only to view a section, change it, or have no access at all. 
This granular permission allocation allows various team members with different roles to work on the same system without risking.
