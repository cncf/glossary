Role-based access control (RBAC) is a security method of managing user access to systems, networks, or resources based on their role within a team or a larger organization. 
RBAC empowers IT administrators to identify the necessary level of access for all users with a particular job function and assign those users a role with a predefined set of permissions. 
Organizations utilize RBAC to provide their employees with varying levels of access tailored to their roles and responsibilities.

## Problem it addresses

RBAC addresses the challenge of controlling the resources team members and applications can access, 
as well as the actions they can perform, especially as the number of applications and team members increases. 
Administrators must ensure that each user has the correct permissions for the resources they need to access.
This task can become cumbersome and error-prone without a structured access control mechanism.


## How it helps

RBAC provides IT teams with the capability to easily manage permissions for all users in a group simultaneously or make swift adjustments to an individual user's access level by assigning or removing a role. 
This safeguards sensitive data and ensures that employees can only access information and perform actions necessary for their job responsibilities. 
Overall, RBAC enhances access management, bolsters security, and boosts operational efficiency within organizations.
