## What it is
Shift Left is the practice of implementing tests, security, or other development practices early in the software development cycle rather than towards the end. Although originally used to refer to the process of testing early, Shift Left can now also be applied to other aspects of software development and DevOps, such as Security and Deployment. 

## Problem it addresses
Security issues, bugs, and software defects can be more difficult and expensive to fix if they are discovered late in the development cycle or after deployment, particuarly if the software has already been deployed into production. 

## How it helps
By adopting a shift left mindset when it comes to software development, teams can implement testing and security throughout the development lifecycle. By sharing responsibility for testing and security, the development team--from   software engineers to quality assurance to devops/operations can all play a part in ensuring the stability and security of an application. 

In addition, shifting left enables continuous improvement and follows more of an agile rather than a waterfall approach to development, as teams can make small iterative improvements and identify problems earlier on. Security and secure development practices can be adopted as early as the design and architecture phase, rather than an afterthought. The pre-release testing cycle can also be much faster and more efficient if testing has been completed throughout the development cycle. 

Software tools and SaaS solutions have been created to address the need for shifting left, however shift left can also be implemented through improved processes and cultural changes within a team.
