## What it is
Digital certificates or public key certificates are issued by a certificate authority (CA). These certificates are electronic files or passwords that allow entities to exchange data or resources over the internet securely. 
Certificates authenticate the user through encryption methods and a set of roles, policies, and resources used to manage, use and revoke certificates and encryptions. Just as a passport certifies an individual's identity, a digital certificate establishes the user's identity. Note that a user can be a person or service within a [microservice](https://glossary.cncf.io/microservices/) app. 

## Problem it addresses
Digital certificates help solve web-based communication security issues. Networks were developed without much thought to security. The most generic set of rules and policies to process data known as protocols, were designed around precepts of robust communication rather than secure transactions. No centralized mechanism was designed and implemented to ensure security over network communiications. Consequently each application developed its own negotiation strategy. Rather than building a generic, reusable security mechanism, applications relied on proprietary or embedded techniques for shuffling account information across the network to the platform or application for validation.

## How it helps
Digital certificates are the most practical option for securing data online. Certificates encrypt internal and external communications to prevent outsiders and phishers from stealing sensitive information. They provide the same encryption quality for small to large businesses alike. 
Digital certificates are highly scalable and can even be used to secure personal devices. Institutions known as public trusted certificate authorities handle the issuance of digital certificates, ensuring they are reliable. Certificate management can be easily centralized through managed public key infrastructure platforms.
