Service level objective (SLO) is a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an [SLI](/service_level_indicator/). SLO is the objective that must be achieved and it reflects a smooth and successful user journey for the User of a service. 

SLO is the key element for [Site Reliability Engineers](/site_reliability_engineering/), [DevOps](/devops/) and Business Teams to measure the quality of the user journey. SLO and Error-budget can be used to balance the delivery of new features to production. SLOs are targets set by engineering teams from the end-user perspective and not the operational or engineering team point of view.
