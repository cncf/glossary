## What it is

A data center is a specialised building or facility designed specifically to house computers, most often servers. Data centers tend to be connected to high-speed internet lines, especially in the case of data centers focused on [cloud computing](/cloud_computing/). The buildings data centers are housed in also have equipment to maintain service even in the case of negative events, such as generators to provide power during outages, as well as powerful air conditioning to deal with waste heat produced by the computers.

## Problem it addresses

Instead of every business having to host their own server equipment where they are located, data centers allow companies and individuals to take advantage of the specialised knowledge and efficiencies of scale of data center providers. This means not having to worry about managing power supply, fire suppression technology, air conditioning or high speed internet connectivity, for example.

## How it helps

For cloud computing, data centers are crucial. As resources and infrastructure can be provisioned according to the [scale of demand](/scalability/), businesses can rent cloud computing resources in a data center without having to worry about forecasting – and potentially under-resourcing or overpaying – for computing resources. As data centers exist all over the world, this allows for provisioning resources geographically near to demand without having to physically ship and set up equipment.
