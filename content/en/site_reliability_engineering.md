## What it is
Site Reliability Engineering or SRE is the discipline that integrate the aspect of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. They combine both the practices focusing on how well the system performs. Although, SRE has some similarity with the term DevOps, the later focuses on getting our code to production, while the former ensures that it works properly once there.

## Problem it addresses
SRE addresses the problem of reliability and monitoring of the system performance, alerting in case of issues, debugging and troubleshooting the system. SRE uses three level of Service Level Commitments to measure the reliability of the system:
Service level agreements(SLAs) define the needed reliability, latency and performance of the system by the desired end users.
Service level objectives(SLOs) benchmarks the target set by SRE teams to met the level of SLA.
Service level indicators(SLOs) measure the metrics showing how much the system confirms the SLOs.

## How it helps
The SRE approach is meant to minimise the costs, time and effort involved in the software development process. SRE relies on measuring and monitoring the entire project infrastructure, as well as each component within it. When something goes wrong, SRE should see when, where and how to fix it. The approach helps in creating highly scalable and reliable software systems by automating operational tasks.
