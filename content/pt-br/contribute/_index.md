O projeto do glossário Cloud Native é mantido [nesse repositório do Github](https://github.com/cncf/glossary), onde você consegue encontrar todas as [*issues*](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/pulls) e [discussões](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/discussions) em aberto.

Você pode contribuir de três formas:

1) Sugerindo novos termos
2) Atualizando termos existentes
3) Traduzindo o glossário para seu idioma nativo

## Faça parte da comunidade do glossário!

<!--
Consider joining our monthly Glossary Working Group meetings if you want to contribute regularly. You can find meeting details in the CNCF calendar. You can also connect with the maintainers and fellow contributors in our #glossary channel on the [CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/) — we'd love to meet you!

## Sugira novos termos
Você pode sugerir um novo termo para outra pessoas trabalharem na definição ou criar você mesmo. De qualquer forma, você deve 
começar abrindo uma *issue* (importante notar que você precisa de uma conta do Github para isso).

Abaixo, temos um passo a passo para caso você ainda não esteja familiarizado com o Github. Caso você já seja familiar com o Github, garanta apenas que você está usando nossos templates de *issues*, com a convenção de nomes correta e seguindo o
[guia de estilo](https://glossary.cncf.io/style-guide/).

### Abrindo uma issue 
Vá para as *issues* do [repositório no Github](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/issues) e clique em "nova issue".

![issues](/images/how-to/howto-01.png)

Você vai ver alguns modelos, para sugerir um novo termo em Português, selecione "Portuguese Language Glossary Request".

![templates](/images/how-to/howto-02.png)

Add the word you're suggesting and hit "submit new issue." If you're just proposing a new term, you're done! To work on it, follow the next steps.

![new issue](/images/how-to/howto-03.png)

Please join the #glossary channel on the CNCF Slack and let @Catherine Paganini, @jmo, and @Seokho Son know that you've submitted an issue and would like to work on it. They'll assign the issue to you signaling to everyone else that the term is already taken.

Here you can see that the first three terms are available while the next term has been assigned to someone.

![assigning a term](/images/how-to/howto-04.png)

Note that you can only claim one term at a time. If you want to work on multiple terms, please finish one before claiming the next.

### Submitting a new term (creating a PR)

Before getting started, please read the [Style Guide](https://glossary.cncf.io/style-guide/) — it will help minimize backs and forth. As stated in the style guide, we highly recommend starting with a Google or Word doc. 

Once the term is ready to submit, go to content (under code)…

![content](/images/how-to/howto-05.png)

…then "en" (or the language you are submitting for)…

![language folder](/images/how-to/howto-06.png)

…and select  _TEMPLATE.md

![template](/images/how-to/howto-07.png)

Copy the content…

![copy content](/images/how-to/howto-08.png)

…and go back to the "en" folder. Hit "add file" and select "create new file."

![create new file](/images/how-to/howto-09.png)

Add the term name in the URL (no capitalization and no space) and .md at the end (if you the preview doesn't work, you probably forgot to add .md). Now past the template content below. Copy and paste your definition into the file. Note that GitHub uses markdown to format the text (e.g., hyperlink, bold, italic). Please refer to this [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). To view how this will look like, go to "preview."

![finalize term](/images/how-to/howto-10.png)

Scroll down and name the new commit file when you are ready to submit. You are now about to commit the term to your own branch. Submitting a PR requires one more step. Hit "commit new file" and…

![commit new file](/images/how-to/howto-11.png)

…now you're creating an PR:

![create a pr](/images/how-to/howto-12.png)

You should now see your PR under "Pull requests."

![prs](/images/how-to/howto-13.png)

## Update an existing term
To update an existing term, you can either suggest a change via an issue or go ahead and update the term directly by submitting a pull request (PR).

### Request a change via an issue
If you want to flag a problem with a term but don't know how or want to fix it yourself, click on "report issue."

![report issue](/images/how-to/howto-14.png)

This will directly open an issue. Please elaborate on which change is needed and why. Hit submit, and that's it. 

![submit issue](/images/how-to/howto-15.png)

### Update a term directly
To change a term directly, go to "edit this page." 

![edit this page](/images/how-to/howto-16.png)

This will open the term's GitHub page. Make your changes and submit a PR. Please refer to "submitting a new term" above for a detailed description (jump to the section that speaks about markdown).

## Help translate the glossary
To help translate the glossary into your native language, please join the #glossary-localizations channel on the CNCF Slack and let us know. You can either join an existing team or create a new one.
