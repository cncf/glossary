## What it is

A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project.

## Problem it addresses

When the software changes periodically, people want to know why and how. It is mandatory to keep log of the software at different versions. 

## How it helps
The changelog makes it easier for the users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.
