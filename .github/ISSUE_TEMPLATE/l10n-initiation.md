# This issue is to initiate a new l10n Team

Please only use this template for submitting a new l10n team initiation requests. 

See https://github.com/cncf/glossary/blob/main/LOCALIZATION.md for basic requirements for a new l10n team.

### (1) The language and language code for l10n
Find localization's two-letter language code from [ISO 639-1 standard](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).

For example, the two-letter code for Korean is `ko`.

 - Language name (ex: `Korean`): 
 - Language two-letter code (ex: `ko`): 


### (2) List of volunteers
Name and GitHub Username for each l10n volunteer. Add `[A]` to make them approvers.

Ex: `- [A] Seokho Son (@seokho-son)`

### (Note) Next actions from maintainers

 - Create a new development branch for the l10n. (ex: `dev-ko`)
 - Update codeowners to add l10n contents approvers.
 - Add a new label for the language.
