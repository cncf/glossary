# Definition Layout

Each definition uses a markdown file to display information about the definition. Currently, there are four requirements for the definition layout to be complete. 

```md
---
title: 
status: 
category: 
---

## Definition

A Quick summary of the concept, what it is.

A few lines of the problem it's addressing.

A few lines of how the thing solves the problem.
```

The first three requirements are contained by two three dash lines.

```md
---
title: 
status: 
category: 
---
```

With the definition located underneath.

# Title

The **title** label will always be at the top of a definition layout and it's contents will be capitalized. 

```md
---
title: Definition Template
```

# Status

The **status** label will come after the title label. The status label helps us understand which definitions are thoroughly vetted or require more effort.

Valid values are: 

- Completed
- Feedback Appreciated 
- Not Started

You can always open an issue against a completed definition. While a definition is in flux, its status will be changed to *Feedback Appreciated*.

```md
---
title: Definition Template
status: Feedback Appreciated
```

# Category

The **category** label will come after the status label, its contents will be capitalized, and consist of the following options:

- Concept

These options give more context as to how the definition is interpreted. For now, **concept** is the only category required.

```md
---
title: Definition Template
status: Feedback Appreciated
category: Concept
---
```

# Definition

The **definition** label will be the final label in the md file. The definition contains three sections to help the give readers context about the core definition. The three sections are:

1. The core definition 
2. The issue it is addressing
3. How it solves or approaches the issue

The three sections should total no more than 300 words, with each section residing on its own line. See the following example:

```md
---
title: Definition Template
status: Feedback Appreciated
category: Concept
---
  A Quick summary of the concept, what it is.

  A few lines of the problem it's addressing.

  A few lines of how the thing solves the problem.
```
