## Origin
The Cloud Native Glossary is a project led by the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee (BVS). Its goal is to explain cloud native concepts in clear and simple language without requiring any previous technological knowledge.

## Contributing
Everybody is invited to suggest changes, additions, and improvements to the Cloud Native Glossary. We employ a community-driven process governed by the CNCF to develop and improve upon this shared lexicon. This Glossary provides a vendor-neutral platform to organize a shared vocabulary around cloud native technologies. Contributions are welcome from all participants who abide by the project's purpose and charter.
Anyone who wishes to make a contribution, may submit a GitHub issue or create a pull request.

## Glossary Entry Format
Each entry should have the following format. Start with a short paragraph of **what it is**, then explain the **problem it addresses**, and close with **how it helps**. Each section shouldn't exceed 100 words (a total of 300 words max per term).

## Guidelines
* To propose specific changes to a glossary entry, edit that entry in your branch and issue a pull request.
* To request that an entry be clarified, updated, or reconsidered, you may alternatively open an issue.
* To propose a new entry to the glossary, either create an issue or, if you have the definition drafted, add the entry to your branch (in its proper alphabetical location) and create a pull request.

## Issues & Pull Requests
* Please jump in and help us out by reviewing open issues and making pull requests to resolve them.
* If you see anything you think can be improved, feel free to open an issue or, even, better submit your suggestions via a pull request.
* Please title your pull requests appropriately, summing up what your commits are about.
* For new terms, make sure that your entry doesn't already exist somewhere else in the Glossary.

## Requests
* For Glossary entry changes and additions, please raise separate pull requests for each entry. This makes it easier to discuss and shepherd updates in self-contained units.
* Please provide links to third-party uses that support your issue or pull request.

## Descriptive vs Prescriptive
* The definition of a term should be based on empirical evidence of contemporary usage as published in literature, academic articles, talks, and white papers.
* In some cases, a term will suffer from conflation, imprecise usage, or, even worse, outright conflicting defintions. In these cases, the Glossary Committers will consider proposed clarifications or focused definitions on a case-by-case basis.
